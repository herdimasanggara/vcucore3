  <h3>Core Studio III<br>Graphic Design 321<br>

    Tuesday and Thursday<br>09:30 AM - 12:50 PM</h3>

    <div class="accordionDrop">
      <p>In Core Studio III, we turn our attention to design’s relationship with society and how systems (political, cultural, social, environmental) constitute the essential landscape in which design functions. Systems thinking is most powerful when it explains and illuminates the broad contexts in which thoughtful, long-lasting design activity has its deepest effect. We explore how systems are interdependent and dynamic. We will also dig deep into what it means to create a visual system that can be applied across varying outcomes to think about consistency, voice, form and language.<br><br>

        In this class we will use the techniques of speculative design and world-building to investigate, critique and hypothesize ‘possible futures’ for society and for ourselves. The work will include research and analysis of existing social systems (collecting texts, images, and media) and the creation of new or alternative forms and systems of organization that pose (explicitly or by inference) alternative ways of thinking and being.</p>

              ⨂ Class overview.<br>
              ⨂ What's your first memory of graphic design?<br>
              ⨂ In an 8.5 by 11 inches Google Docs file, create a creative resume. In this exercise, I'm <i>not</i> expecting you to create a professional resume. Try to reorient your preconceived notions of what resume looks like. If you can create
              a piece of paper that represents yourself, how would that piece of paper look like? Are you still listing your achievements? Are you going to draw your face in the entire piece of paper? Is the background of your resume still white?
              Save the finished product as a .pdf file and send it to anggarah@vcu.edu.<br>
              ⨂ Create an <a href="https://www.are.na/" target="_blank">Are.na</a> channel if you don't have one. Install <a href="https://www.are.na/tools/bookmarklet" target="_blank">Are.na Chrome extension</a> and read <a
                href="https://support.are.na/help/how-do-i-use-the-browser-extension" target="_blank">the tutorial</a> how to use it.<br><br>
              ⨀ In your Are.na channel, collect 5 items (it could be images or texts) that embodies complex infrastructure systems (e.g. ant colonies, syntax in linguistics, professions in Stardew Valley, Pokémon battle systems, layers of reality in
              Nathan Fielder's The Rehearsal, etc.). These 5 items have to be tangentially related to each other. On Thursday, each student needs to talk about their findings in the class. The rules are that a) it needs to be something that you're
              interested in and b) you have to talk about your findings in class at least 7 minutes. No less. <mark>Send the links of your Are.na channels on August 25th at 8 AM by the latest.</mark>

              ⨂ Talk about your findings in the class as if we know nothing about the topic.<br>
              ⨂ Expand your Are.na collection. Organize a collection of at least 20 images per community/structure/system that you identify. In your Are.na channels, add tags or descriptors with each image to begin generating a lexicon. Consider hierarchies of systems (subsystems, tangential systems) as you build up your initial collection.<br><br>
              ⨀ Read <a href="https://readings.design/PDF/speculative-everything.pdf" target="_blank">Dunne & Raby's Speculative Everything</a> (chapter 1–3).<br>
              ⨀ Make a reading response. The reading response doesn't need to be a piece of writing, it could be <i>anything</i>. Does the reading remind you of the recent music video that you've watched? Are you going to sketch
              the reading response? Are you going to make direct annotations to the .pdf file? Create a new block titled <i>Reading Responses</i> in your Are.na channels and and put your response in it.<br>

              ⨂ In 11 by 17 inches Photoshop or Illustrator files (or physical papers if you're more comfortable with tactility), start rough sketching 2 different variations of diagrams that represent your research. Are there elements that can be simplified? Or vice versa, are there elements that can be problematized? What kind of underlying structures that act as a foundation for your diagram? As you start developing your contents, what is the best organizing principle of your items/keywords? <mark>This is due by Thursday.</mark><br><br>

              ⨂ Find as much visual vernacular as you can that are related to the systems that you're currently researching about. Try to answer these two big questions: 1) What forms that are often associated with the subject that you're currently researching (e.g. worldbuilding -> maps; software -> printed circuit board; architecture -> floorplans, etc.) and 2) what details that are inherently embedded into those forms? (e.g. maps -> index, borders, topology; printed circuit board -> resistors, capacitors, sensors; floorplan -> walls, doors, stairs, etc.)<br><br>
              ⨀ Next week we're going to do individual critique and I expect you to come to class with these progress:<br>
              ⨮ Continue developing one of the diagrams that you've already started.<br>
              ⨮ Try to finalize the content of your diagrams.<br>
              ⨮ Decide what dimension that is appropriate for the subject that you've chosen.<br>
              ⨮ Start researching and experimenting with the materials (e.g. vellum, piece of fabric, plastic, cardboard, plywood, etc.) and try to think how your diagram will look like on a flat surface.

              ⨂ Read Hugh Dubberly's Creating Concept Maps. If you're still stuck with how to visualize your diagrams, his step-by-step instructions might be useful way to start. These questions might also be useful to pose it on your own: What is the primary topic of the diagram? What is it trying to show? How does the organization/form of the diagram reflect this? How clear is the terminology? Are grammatical choices consistent and enabling comparison between parallel items?<br>
              ⨂ Read Mark Monmoier's How to Lie with Maps (introduction and chapter 3). The tools for map generalization that he described on chapter 3 might be useful in developing your diagrams further (simplification, enhancement, segmentation, etc.). <mark>At the end of the class</mark>, I want you to create a reading response specifically for this reading and you have to post it to your Are.na.<br><br>

              ⨂ For the rest, please use the remainder of the class either a) keep working on your diagrams or b) start doing the in-class exercise described below.<br>
              ⨂ In an A0 (33.11 by 46.81 inches) dimension, create a self-portrait. The definition of self-portrait is open to interpretation, but it must in some way reference the body as an organizing principle. How you represent yourself is up to you: photography, drawing, type, infographic elements, screen-captures, and any mixture that supports your overall concept. The poster must include both visual and verbal information/datadata, with each contributing significantly to the delivery of content. The final poster should function equally well at a display distance and a reading distance. The production method of the poster may vary, depending on need/concept. <i>Avoid making a
                photorealistic line drawing of yourself/your friend through tracing.</i> Aim for unexpected discovery of tools that you are not familiar with (e.g. the less you know about Illustrator, the better the outcome).<br>

            <div class="left">
              The departmental faculty have drafted a revised attendance policy, carefully considering the challenges and realities of holding classes in different spaces and in fractured time frames.<br><br>
              The standard VCU attendance policy states that student absences during the semester are not expected to exceed the number of times the class meets in one week. Our department has adopted a revised policy that addresses larger issues of
              expected engagement in a course. Consistent engagement is a vital component of successful completion of course objectives. The progression of this course requires all participants to be present and actively engaged in class, both during
              synchronous on-screen meetings, in person, and with asynchronous activities. Consistency of engagement is vital for successful completion of the course objectives. Each of us carries different circumstances and capacities; we are
              accountable for our own agency. This is always true, but especially crucial now. We are a community.<br><br>

              Be present for this class; participate consistently in the regular give-and-take of the classroom environment; be willing to share thoughts and experiences, as well as willing to actively listen to the thoughts and experiences of
              others.<br><br>

              Asynchronous engagement is equally important for your success in this course. If at any point during the semester you are unable to be present, communicate this clearly with me in a timely manner. Think about the manners in which you
              feel you will be able to be fully present and active with your community—this may differ from how others respond.<br><br>

              This class operates on the principle of charity, respect, and good faith. The responsibility to uphold and bolster these principles falls equally on all members of the class. Active listening is as important as active participation,
              please be gracious and generous with both. Connecting with peers is encouraged but does not substitute for communicating with the instructor directly. Contact me as soon as possible prior to, or after you miss a class. It is your
              responsibility to make-up for missing work.
