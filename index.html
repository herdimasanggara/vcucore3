  <h3>Core Studio III<br>Graphic Design 321<br>
    anggarah@vcu.edu<br>
    Tuesday and Thursday<br>09:30 AM - 12:50 PM</h3>

    <div class="accordionDrop">
      <p>In Core Studio III, we turn our attention to design’s relationship with society and how systems (political, cultural, social, environmental) constitute the essential landscape in which design functions. Systems thinking is most powerful when it
        explains and illuminates the broad contexts in which thoughtful, long-lasting design activity has its deepest effect. We explore how systems are interdependent and dynamic. We will also dig deep into what it means to create a visual system
        that can be applied across varying outcomes to think about consistency, voice, form and language.<br><br>

        In this class we will use the techniques of speculative design and world-building to investigate, critique and hypothesize ‘possible futures’ for society and for ourselves. The work will include research and analysis of existing social
        systems (collecting texts, images, and media) and the creation of new or alternative forms and systems of organization that pose (explicitly or by inference) alternative ways of thinking and being.</p>

              ⨂ Class overview.<br>
              ⨂ What's your first memory of graphic design?<br>
              ⨂ In an 8.5 by 11 inches Google Docs file, create a creative resume. In this exercise, I'm <i>not</i> expecting you to create a professional resume. Try to reorient your preconceived notions of what resume looks like. If you can create a piece of paper that represents yourself, how would that piece of paper look like? Are you still listing your achievements? Are you going to draw your face in the entire piece of paper? Is the background of your resume still white? Save the finished product as a .pdf file and send it to anggarah@vcu.edu.<br>
              ⨂ Create an <a href="https://www.are.na/" target="_blank">Are.na</a> channel if you don't have one. Install <a href="https://www.are.na/tools/bookmarklet" target="_blank">Are.na Chrome extension</a> and read <a href="https://support.are.na/help/how-do-i-use-the-browser-extension" target="_blank">the tutorial</a> how to use it.<br><br>
              ⨀ In your Are.na channel, collect 5 items (it could be images or texts) that embodies complex infrastructure systems (e.g. ant colonies, syntax in linguistics, professions in Stardew Valley, Pokémon battle systems, layers of reality in Nathan Fielder's The Rehearsal, etc.). These 5 items have to be tangentially related to each other. On Thursday, each student needs to talk about their findings in the class. The rules are that a) it needs to be something that you're interested in and b) you have to talk about your findings in class at least 7 minutes. No less. <mark>Send the links of your Are.na channels on August 25th at 8 AM by the latest.</mark>

              ⨂ Talk about your findings in the class as if we know nothing about the topic.<br><br>
              ⨀ Read <a href="https://readings.design/PDF/speculative-everything.pdf" target="_blank">Dunne & Raby's Speculative Everything</a> (chapter 1–3).<br>
              ⨀ Make a reading response. The reading response doesn't need to be a piece of writing, it could be <i>anything</i>. Does the reading remind you of the recent music video that you've watched? Are you going to sketch the reading response? Are you going to make direct annotations to the .pdf file?
